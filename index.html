                            Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city
                            located on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of
                            course, no one in their right mind would swim in the
                            river, unless they grew up here, in which case
                            they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are
                            hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall
                            and the spring are are absolutely amazing.

                            The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war
                            and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with
                            modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of
                            the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse
                            for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The
                            left bank is considered far less interesting and
                            prestigious though, even by people who live on the
                            far outskirts of the right one.

                            town below from a rock that juts out into the sea.
                            It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the
                            Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the
                            self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                            Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination

                            sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact
                            that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                            years in a row for its spectacular floral displays

                            According to the Hebrew Bible, Beersheba was founded
                            when Abraham and Abimelech settled their differences
                            over a well of water and made a covenant Abimelech's
                            men had taken the well from Abraham after he had
                            previously dug it so Abraham brought sheep and
                            cattle to Abimelech to get the well back. He set
                            aside seven lambs to swear that it was he that had
                            dug the well and no one else. Abimelech conceded
                            that the well belonged to Abraham and, in the Bible,
                            Beersheba means "Well of Seven" .
